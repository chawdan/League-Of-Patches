# League Of Patches(Entry for Riot API Challenge 2.0's 2nd Prompt)
Want to know how strong/weak champions become after Riot made their changes in the recent patch(Cough AP Items patch Cough)? Well look no more! 

After every patch, the win rates of champions fluxuate depending on how severe the nerfs/buffs on the champions/items are. As an entry to the League of Legends API Challenge 2.0, we want to guide the great community that is League of Legends in what are the ripple effects of the changes and how severe they are in changing the meta. With a weekly updating basis, the items and champions' win rate, kda, and popularity are shown in the front page of our website, displayed in a clear and concise timeline graph. More demos will be displayed as the project develops its frontend. Stay tuned!
